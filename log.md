### Day 5: Aug, 13 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML/CSS section in Odin Project. Started Box Model section. Worked on PNPT AD lab setup.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get any time in on Python today but, made good progress on both Odin tasks and PNPT AD lab setup.
Should be able to actually start doing AD labs tomorrow and will spend some time progressing ZTM Python course too.

### Day 4: Aug, 12 2023

**Today's Progress**: Limited progress today, but I did go through the Project Odin CSS/Typography lesson.

**Thoughts**: Between some work responsibilities and general tiredness, I was happy just to not miss spending time on coding
today.

### Day 3: Aug, 11 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished Odin first HTML project. Start next ZTM section on Python (flow control).
Started TCM PNPT AD Labs section.

**Thoughts** I decided to include all my study topics here (not just coding) as they are related and the 
goal from all efforts is the same: improve my skillset and continual learning. The Odin basic HTML project
is a bit boring and a slog as the backend web dev is my primary interest right now but, I don't want to skip
the basic building blocks (though I already have experience with HTML).

On the TCM PNPT front, I have committed to see if I can get through all the required courses and sit the exam
by mid-Sept. It might be too aggressive but, I'll find out and adjust as needed. One of the joys of living rural
is that things that seem basic can be hard to get. Example, I need a VGA cable for a "new" but, none of the local
stores have one. So, my labs in PNPT are going to wait until tomorrow. Today, I've been reviewing the topics and 
related processes so I can hit the ground running once I have everything setup tomorrow afternoon.

### Day 2: Aug, 10 2023

**Today's Progress**: ZTM Python Course (finished data types section).

**Thoughts** Late start today due to a family visit (whoo!) but, still going through the html content on The Odin
Project. Mostly review but, I'm also finishing up the data types section on the ZTM Python course. Also started tweeting
daily progress yesterday with #100DaysOfCoding. 

### Day 1: Aug, 9 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts** I'll be looking at both RoR and Python. I'll focus on RoR for longer term web dev (and may shift to Rust)
later) and Python for general systems level scripting/tools.

I'll also be working through various study/learning resources (ZTM, Odin Project, etc).
