### Day 1: Aug, 9 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts** I'll be looking at both RoR and Python. I'll focus on RoR for longer term web dev (and may shift to Rust)
later) and Python for general systems level scripting/tools.

I'll also be working through various study/learning resources (ZTM, Odin Project, etc).
