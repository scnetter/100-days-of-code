### Day 3: Aug, 11 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished Odin first HTML project. Start next ZTM section on Python (flow control).
Started TCM PNPT AD Labs section.

**Thoughts** I decided to include all my study topics here (not just coding) as they are related and the 
goal from all efforts is the same: improve my skillset and continual learning. The Odin basic HTML project
is a bit boring and a slog as the backend web dev is my primary interest right now but, I don't want to skip
the basic building blocks (though I already have experience with HTML). 

On the TCM PNPT front, I have committed to see if I can get through all the required courses and sit the exam
by mid-Sept. It might be too aggressive but, I'll find out and adjust as needed.

### Day 2: Aug, 10 2023

**Today's Progress**: ZTM Python Course (finished data types section).

**Thoughts** Late start today due to a family visit (whoo!) but, still going through the html content on The Odin
Project. Mostly review but, I'm also finishing up the data types section on the ZTM Python course. Also started tweeting
daily progress yesterday with #100DaysOfCoding. 

### Day 1: Aug, 9 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts** I'll be looking at both RoR and Python. I'll focus on RoR for longer term web dev (and may shift to Rust)
later) and Python for general systems level scripting/tools.

I'll also be working through various study/learning resources (ZTM, Odin Project, etc).
