### Day 14: Jan 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Coursework finished up today with final Vue/Axios lecture and exercise. We selected our final capstone project - ours will be a Comic Book exchange site built using Vue/Axios/Vue router on the client side that interacts with a Java/SpringMVC with PostgreSQL backend. 

This will be interesting and, there's a lot to pull together so, it should help solidify the curriculum as we'll be using most of what was covered over the past 3 months.

Additionally, I added the ability to edit the posts in the Rails blog project. It's pretty straight forward but, getting used to all the things Rails does for you auto-magically is still my biggest struggle. Regardless, it's nice to be touching Rails/Ruby code again. 

**Thoughts**:
### Day 14: Jan 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Vue using Axios to query backend server (or statuc JSON file in the instance of our exercise).

Spent time understanding the concept of promises, async requests and passing data between component. 

Additionally, continued work on Ralis blog project (I think everyone that has ever looked at a computer has built a blog project in the language of their choice).

**Thoughts**: Today, the Vue work was easier to understand as I became more familiar with the standard patterns for CRUD actities. 

Porgressed on the Rails project by adding a post endpoint to create a new post. Good coverage of standard actions and what assumptions and conventions are relevant. 

My mind has been spinning a bit the past few days considering what I should build once I'm a bit more adept with the patterns and am ready to create my own. 

Some current ideas:

- Build a Rails based native app (todo list or task manager most likely) - 
    - See if I can deploy to my phone.
- Commerce site for my daughter
    - Stripe
    - Paypal
    - etc
- Others? Early days still~
### Day 13: Jan 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Curriculum today focused on starting learning about using Axios on the client to interaction with and send/recv requests to a backend (Java/Spring in our case).

This was an initial discussion around usage/theory with implementation and exercises to follow tomorrow.

Additionally, spent time going through more Rails blog project activities adding initial root path and #show actions for individual posts. Still basic but Rails is always fun - even the basic stuff.

**Thoughts**: Getting close to the end of the bootcamp with a final Capstone upcoming. This will be to tie everything together (JavaScript, Vue, Axios, Java, Spring). Frankly, we've covered a ton of material in the last few months and now, the challenge is integrating that info so it's more accessible rather than needing to refer to notes frequently.

Still, it's amazing how much we've touched in a fairly short period of time. I don't know how others in my cohort who started this without previous coding experience are doing it as, it's definitely been "drinking from the firehose".

### Day 12: Jan 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Curriculum today focused on continuing coverage of the Router function in Vue including redirects. Addditionally, I completed the Beginner Ruby course on GoRails and am going to start the Rails learning projects next.

**Thoughts**: I feel more comfortable with the backend (Java/Spring) content compared to Vue but, I'm also more familiar with the backend as well so, I'm sure, over time, the frontend frameworks will be similarly familiar. 

Going back and forth between Ruby/Rails and Java/Vue is a bit harder but, since the Ruby/Rails stuff is a refresher, it's manageable and I think it gives me more context as I learn concepts or patterns that I have not seen or used previously.

### Day 11: Jan 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on Ruby refresher courses. Going to make sure I'm familiarized with base Ruby before starting some Rails learning projects.

**Thoughts**: So far, not a lot seems to have changed since I was working with and learning Ruby previously. Most of the material is familiar and just a matter of stretching those old Ruby muscles.

### Day 10: Jan 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Today we spent some more time going over Vuex and then transitioned to an initial discussion of Vue router (router/index.js).

Similar to what I've seen in Node/Rails. Not the same by any means but, again, more like a different dialect rather than a completely new language.

*Personal Study* - I started going through the initial GoRails.com course material. It's mostly review but, I can use the refresher. Intent is to complete the basic course tomorrow (Saturday) and start the Rails projects. It's been a while and I'm unsure how much has changed or how much I remember. However, I'm excited to get started.

**Thoughts**: One of the aspects of Vue that I'm not a huge fan of is how many tools are involved with creating a comprehensive and functional app. 

Of course, the flexibility is a plus when that is needed as you can easily change the various tools as needed (easily might be a bit optimistic for me but - for a dev experienced with the framework and it's eco-system I'll assume it's not a huge challenge).

However, I compare that to more opinionated frameworks that attempt to create a fairly cohesive environment and, for beginners, or even folks who want to ramp up quickly and focus on the end product rather than the nuts and bolts, I can see how it would be distracting and consume cycles better spent on creating something you can use quickly.

Of course, I could change my opinion as I get more experience. This is just my perspective at this moment in time.
### Day 9: Jan 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Focus today was on reviewing previous topic of event handling in Vue and then beginning to learn about Vuex as datastore for Vue and how the components communicate and pass information. 

Currently using static objects and arrays in the store/state but the intent is to transition to a connected DB in the future.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting how various frameworks are very similar. The {{}}'s in Vue along with the various directives (v-on, v-bind, etc) take a bit of getting used to but, it's pretty straightforward once you're over that hump. I'm sure it will take time to be completely comfortable but, all in all, it's not overwhelming as Vue has a lot of cognates with any number of other frameworks from what I can see.
### Day 8: Jan 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Coursework today focused on learning about Vue Event-Handling and the MVVM architecture (how it compares to MVC). Completed exercise implementing a userlist and filter using a Vue component and the associated data, computed and method sections. 

Evening activity involved assisting a classmate with an issue and then working through additional learning content on Node.js (deploying a MongoDb instance using Docker to be used with my ongoing Node.js project).

**Thoughts**: Although the Vue material probably won't be directly relevant to wherever I land based on general usage/popularity, gaining some experience with the concepts and general awareness of the framework is useful (and interesting). 
### Day 7(?): Jan, 2 2024

**Today's Progress**: The (?) is because, though I've not posted here for a while, I've actually been actively coding over the last several months. I'm finishing up a bootcamp focused on Java/Springboot, Javascript, Vue.js and I've been submitting code most days in a private gitlab repo. I'm going to start updating this log with that activity (not sur ewhy I didn't think to do this before) but, as a compromise, I won't estimate the # of days missed and will just start with the next day I would have logged (Day 7).

**Thoughts**: Today was focused on some initial exercises using Vue.js. I'm also working through some self-study using Node.js/Express.

### Day 6: Aug, 15 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished PNPT AD Lab setup. Did a few Python modules on ZTM and started Odin Box model exercises.

**Thoughts**: Dedicating most of my time to PNPT work for the next few weeks but, I will continue to spend time daily on 
coding. I'll be splitting coding time between ZTM and Odin.

Today was roughly 3-4 hours on PNPT and about 1-2 hours on coding specifically.

### Day 6 - Not Counted: Aug, 14 2023

**Today's Progress**: Missed Day

**Thoughts**: Took a rest day. I'll only count days that I actually progress and, as per project Odin guidelines, never 
two days in a row.

### Day 5: Aug, 13 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML/CSS section in Odin Project. Started Box Model section. Worked on PNPT AD lab setup.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get any time in on Python today but, made good progress on both Odin tasks and PNPT AD lab setup.
Should be able to actually start doing AD labs tomorrow and will spend some time progressing ZTM Python course too.

### Day 4: Aug, 12 2023

**Today's Progress**: Limited progress today, but I did go through the Project Odin CSS/Typography lesson.

**Thoughts**: Between some work responsibilities and general tiredness, I was happy just to not miss spending time on coding
today.

### Day 3: Aug, 11 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished Odin first HTML project. Start next ZTM section on Python (flow control).
Started TCM PNPT AD Labs section.

**Thoughts** I decided to include all my study topics here (not just coding) as they are related and the 
goal from all efforts is the same: improve my skillset and continual learning. The Odin basic HTML project
is a bit boring and a slog as the backend web dev is my primary interest right now but, I don't want to skip
the basic building blocks (though I already have experience with HTML).

On the TCM PNPT front, I have committed to see if I can get through all the required courses and sit the exam
by mid-Sept. It might be too aggressive but, I'll find out and adjust as needed. One of the joys of living rural
is that things that seem basic can be hard to get. Example, I need a VGA cable for a "new" but, none of the local
stores have one. So, my labs in PNPT are going to wait until tomorrow. Today, I've been reviewing the topics and 
related processes so I can hit the ground running once I have everything setup tomorrow afternoon.

### Day 2: Aug, 10 2023

**Today's Progress**: ZTM Python Course (finished data types section).

**Thoughts** Late start today due to a family visit (whoo!) but, still going through the html content on The Odin
Project. Mostly review but, I'm also finishing up the data types section on the ZTM Python course. Also started tweeting
daily progress yesterday with #100DaysOfCoding. 

### Day 1: Aug, 9 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts** I'll be looking at both RoR and Python. I'll focus on RoR for longer term web dev (and may shift to Rust)
later) and Python for general systems level scripting/tools.

I'll also be working through various study/learning resources (ZTM, Odin Project, etc).
